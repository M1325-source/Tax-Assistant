Tax Assistant – Automated Tax Filing & Deductions Calculator

Project Description
The Tax Assistant is a Python-based tool that automates tax calculations, identifies applicable deductions, and simplifies the tax filing process. It processes user data, applies tax brackets, and provides an estimated tax due based on income and filing status.

Features

✅ Deductions Finder – Identifies available standard and itemized deductions.
✅ Data Processing Module – Validates and processes user financial data.
✅ Scalable & Extendable – Can be modified to include state taxes, additional deductions, and new tax laws.

How It Works
User Inputs – Provide income, filing status (single/married), and deductions.
Data Processing – The system validates and structures the input.
Tax Calculation – Uses progressive tax brackets to estimate tax due.
